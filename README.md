## Usage
In order to start the project you must first initialize a package.json file by running the command `npm init -y`.
The next step is to install inquirer by running the command `npm i inquirer`, the last install would be jest in order to be able to run the tests for the classes. The command needed to install jest is `npm i -D jest`. Once you have everything installed you can run the command `npm run test` in the terminal in order to run all the tests for the classes. In order to begin generating an html page you must go to the root of the project and open the terminal and run the command `node index.js`, prompts will appear and once you finish answering all of them the generated html page will appear in the root of the project.

## Challenges
The main challenge for this project was figuring out the logic for the prompts to change based on the choice of an intern or an engineer. There was also trouble figuring out how to work with asynchronous functions in order to run lines of code once a promise is resolved.

## Features
The only thing needed from the used is to answer a couple prompts and the code will generate the rest for you.
## Future Development
The path wanted for this project is to eventually be able to create more than just five member cards in order to be able to create larger teams.
